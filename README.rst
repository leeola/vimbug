VimBug
======

VimBug is a plugin for vim that creates an integrated debugging environment
focused on the debugging of Python applications. It is also intended to
work with any DBGp compliant server, it just hasn't been reliably 
*-- if at all --*  tested on any servers other than Python.

It is an attempted rewrite/continuation of where
`Jared Forsyth <http://jaredforsyth.com>`_ left off with 
`vim-debug <http://jaredforsyth.com/projects/vim-debug>`_. Once Jared gets
back and is able to program again, it would be great to merge some of this
code into vim-debug, but it seems less and less likely as time goes on. The
rewrite is beginning to be quite and undertaking, and who knows what can
be brought back into vim-debug. That problem can be tackled when it comes
up. Until then, this project will *attempt* to add new features and
improve code.

Thanks for the wonderful work Jared!

Features
--------
 - The rewrite has broken basically everything. Please stand by.

Planned
-------
 - To obtain feature unity with vim-debug
 - Remove vim_debug references and straight libraries, so that the
   two projects can exist side by side.
 - Rewrite of much of the core, to allow for easier unit testing and
   a refined/extensible interface.
